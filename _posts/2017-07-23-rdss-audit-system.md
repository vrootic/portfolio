## RDSS Audit System

This project is when I was serving in Alternative Military Service in Taiwan.

The project accelerated my daily tasks and brought benefits to accounting room.

This project has several goody features including,
- Registration searching with part of information(names, ID, or echelon)
- Calculate the salary for the next month
- Record the base salary and automatically store records
- Categorize in service/out of service people
- Upload excel file from other department and audit those records
